        Iâ€™m Atul and I am currently an undergraduate student in my penultimate
        year of a Bachelor of Engineering (Honours) degree specialising in
        Software Engineering at the University of Auckland. At university, I am
        building a solid foundation in software development through projects via
        the clubs I am a part of and through the courses I have enrolled in.
        <br />
        <br />
        So far I have worked on frontend development using React and backend
        systems with Python and Java. I have also worked on iOS development
        using Swift and SwiftUI during my time at Alimetry! Recently, Iâ€™ve been
        motivated to do the daily LeetCode and so a blog about my non-optimal
        approaches to these problems will be out soon.
        <br />
        <br />
        Outside of my studies, I climb religiously and work on my car (an
        imolarot2 BMW E46 330i ðŸš—) when it has problems (currently problem
        free!!).
