          Iâ€™m Atul and I am currently an undergraduate student in my penultimate
          year of a Bachelor of Engineering (Honours) degree specialising in
          Software Engineering at the University of Auckland. At university, I
          am trying my best to build a solid foundation in software development.
          So far I have worked on frontend development using React and backend
          systems with Python and Java. I have also worked on iOS development
          using Swift and SwiftUI during my time at Alimetry! Recently, Iâ€™ve
          been motivated to do the daily LeetCode and so a blog about my
          non-optimal approaches to these problems will be out soon (inspired
